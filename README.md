# Retirement-Investment-Calc

Overview:

  While the front end of this calculator still needs work, feel free to pull up the javascript file in repl.it (https://repl.it/CmPu/6) and use the variable names to input the appropriate values. To see the unfinished front end, click here: https://jsfiddle.net/d9oz354p/
  
  This calculator was conceived of after a rather intense chapter of learning about personal finance. During that time, I had a favorite retirement calculator that just disappeared from the internet one day! So I figured I would try to recreate it and even improve upon it (since it was probably made in the early 2000's...)
  
  The basic premise of this calculator is to show the power of compounding interest over time. This calculator has been a great asset for me when I need a little help with remembering to save money ;).

  
Note on progress:

  This is the first project that I conceived of myself! It has been a really cool, challenging, and rewarding experience.
  
  While I am really proud of this site, there are still a number of things that I need to learn in order to fix/ put finishing touches on the site. This list is as follows:
  
    1. Take user input and send it to my Javascript file for processing
    2. Dynamically create a table to input the appropriate JS return values
    3. Figure out why the ordered list on the "About" page is not working!
    4. Finish styling the site.
    5. Finishing Touches!
